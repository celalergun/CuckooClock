# CuckooClock
A simple clock/form that reminds you how fast time goes by while you're procrastinating. 

This program uses a special class called Application Context that acts like a form for the main body of a program. 
The program displays a clock window at the beginning of an hour (e.g. both the minute and the second is 00).
